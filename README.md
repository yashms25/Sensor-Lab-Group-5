### Project Info

<p>
  Ultrasonic sensors are installed on one sides of the cap so it that measure the minimum distance to be maintained by the individual in 360 degrees. Also a buzzer is installed which alerts the individual by giving a buzzer upon not maintaining a minimum distance. The reason to design this social distancing reminder in form of a cap is that compared to a band or a belt this would of easy use. As cap is a commonly used item by every person be it a child or an adult. In case of a band, the band may not measure the distance in 360 degrees. And the sensors should be exposed so, in case of a belt the person must tuck his shirt which may not be comfortable to everyone.
We are using 1 ultrasonic sensors which are placed at 1 sides of the cap as shown in the cad design. so using this we can maintain proper social distance among individuals. If the proper social distance is not maintained in three directions this cap will alert the person. To alert the person we are using buzzer.
